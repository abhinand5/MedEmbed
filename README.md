# MedEmbed

MedEmbed is a collection of embedding models fine-tuned specifically for medical and clinical data.

## Project Overview

MedEmbed aims to provide high-quality embedding models that are tailored for use in medical and clinical contexts. These models are designed to capture the nuances and complexities of medical terminology and concepts, making them particularly useful for a wide range of healthcare-related natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Key Features

- Fine-tuned embedding models focused on medical and clinical data
- Improved performance on healthcare-specific NLP tasks
- Multiple model variants to suit different use cases and computational requirements

## Model Variants

MedEmbed includes several model variants, each fine-tuned using different strategies:

## Performance

Our models have been evaluated on various medical NLP benchmarks for retrieval, including:

- ArguAna
- MedicalQARetrieval
- NFCorpus
- PublicHealthQA
- TRECCOVID

Detailed performance metrics and comparisons are available in our documentation.
